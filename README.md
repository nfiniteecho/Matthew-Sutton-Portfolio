## Welcome to Matthew Sutton's IA Portfolio
Hello! 

Here I have accumlated a few papers and projects from my University of Nebraska Omaha Cybersecurity coursework.  You will find each displayed product in the PDFs folder and a description of each project further down in this README.  Specifically, the papers I have included are:

* Amazon Echo Dot v2 Penetration Test Final Summary
  * [Full Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jhautry/echo-dot)
* Reserach and Test-bed Demonstration of the ZeuS Trojan Horse
* An Introduction to Public-Key Cryptography Semester Paper
* USAF Tongue and Quill Staff Study Regarding Apple Product Tagged Image File Format CVE


## Project/Paper Details

### IA Capstone Project - Echo Dot v2 Penetration Test
#### Products:

[Full Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jhautry/echo-dot)

[Final Project Summary Document](https://github.com/nfiniteecho/Matthew-Sutton-Portfolio/blob/master/PDFs/IA%20Capstone%20Project%20-%20Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%20v2%20Penetration%20Testing%20Final%20Summary.pdf)

#### Details:

The IA Capstone class was the final CYBR/IA 4580 Certification and Accreditation capstone course at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.   Students were tasked to "extend and apply their knowledge, accumulated from their undergraduate studies, towards defining, implementing, and assessing secured information systems." We also were required to "demonstrate our ability to specify, apply, and assess different types of countermeasures at different points in a system or enterprise."  The course content can be viewed [here](https://github.com/MLHale/CYBR4580).  

Overall, a lot of work was done to breakdown the inner workings of the Echo Dot v2.  Our team built a myriad of different diagrams and wrote lots of documentation.  Per course requirements, we created five "User Stories" applying to general user function and determined what could be done to exploit each User Story.

The project went through three milestones with the following grading points:
* [Milestone 1](https://github.com/MLHale/CYBR4580/blob/master/projects/milestone1.md): Executive Project Summary, Project Timeline, Project-oriented Risk List, Application Requirements, Resources/Technology Needed, and First Sprint Plan
* [Milestone 2](https://github.com/MLHale/CYBR4580/blob/master/projects/milestone2.md): Architectural Diagrams, Beginning Activity Diagrams, Beginning User Story Realizations, Milestone 3 Planning, and Presentation
* [Milestone 3 (Final)](https://github.com/MLHale/CYBR4580/blob/master/projects/milestone3.md): Final Activity Diagrams, Final User Story Realizations, Packaging and Release, and Presentation

All of these grading points are displayed in GitHub repo.  The Final Sumamry Document was created for the "Packaging and Release" grading point.

### IA Fundamentals Project - Reserach and Test-bed Demonstration of the ZeuS Trojan Horse
#### Product:

[Full Project Paper](https://github.com/nfiniteecho/Matthew-Sutton-Portfolio/blob/master/PDFs/IA%20Fundamentals%20Project%20-%20Research%20and%20Test-bed%20Demonstration%20of%20the%20ZeuS%20Trojan%20Horse.pdf)

#### Details:

The IA Fundamentals project had four separate tracks for students to take.  I chose my own custom project to download and test the ZeuS Trojan Horse.  ZeuS is one of the most notorious pieces of banking malware that was responsible for millions of dollars in stolen money using a global network of money mules. In 2011, the source code for the ZeuS malware was leaked online.  I found it on GitHub and went to work compiling and testing it.  

This project outlines my compilation of the source code and an in-depth examination of bot functionality in an airgapped test environment.  I researched ZeuS' capabilities and underlying infection operations.  A fake custom bank website was created to show ZeuS' keylogging abilities, HTML injection abilities via man-in-the-browser attacks, and screenshotting abilities to bypass clickable PIN authentication interfaces.

### Advanced Composition Semester Paper - An Introduction to Public-Key Cryptography
#### Product:

[Semester Paper](https://github.com/nfiniteecho/Matthew-Sutton-Portfolio/raw/master/Advanced%20Writing%20Coursework/Technical%20Writing%20Semester%20Paper%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Public-Key%20Cryptography.pdf)

[Additional Coursework](https://github.com/nfiniteecho/Matthew-Sutton-Portfolio/tree/master/Advanced%20Writing%20Coursework)

##### Details:

This course required one advanced technical paper to be constructed over the course of an entire semester.  I chose my topic to be public-key cryptography because this topic is an fundamental concept for all IA professionals to comprehend. Over the semester we were required to complete five assignemnts all compounding upon one-another:
1. Write a memo describing the subject of my paper including research strategy and preliminary research
2. Write a proposal for the report including a cover letter
3. Submit a draft and style sheet for report including a cover letter explaining more progress
4. In-class presentation with narrated powerpoint and a separate detailed outline of the presentation
5. Submit final report with included transmittal letter

The final report covers the following main topics to build an encompassing explaination of public-key cryptography for a lay audience:
* Cryptography Fundamentals
* Secret-Key Cryptography
* Public-Key Cryptography
* RSA Key-Exchange

### Computer Security Management - Staff Study

#### Product:

[Staff Study](https://github.com/nfiniteecho/Matthew-Sutton-Portfolio/blob/master/PDFs/Computer%20Security%20Management%20Semester%20Project%20-%20Staff%20Study.pdf)

#### Details:

The Semester Project was to write a staff study  over one of three instructor selected Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).  The staff study was requried to be formatted using [*The Tongue and Quill*](http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_cio_a6/publication/afh33-337/afh33-337.pdf) Air Force communication resource.  I chose to write my Staff Study on [CVE-2016-4631](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4631) which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted TIFF file.  The staff study is designed to be a three-tiered study.  The top level is written to analyze a problem, draw conclusions, and make recommendations at the management level.  The second level is written as a technical analysis for middle level support.  The third level is a deep technical analysis for technical support.
